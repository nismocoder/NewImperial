            <p>Imperial Touge stickers are decals rather than paper stickers that you’re familiar with. They don't fall apart when
                they get wet.</p><br>
            <p>The stickers are UV-rsistant, weatherproof and rated for outdoor use! 1-3 years under normal conditions for standard
                laminates.</p><br>
            <p><strong>What are the different types of stickers?</strong></p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Kiss Cut comes on a rectangular sheet of backing paper with transfer tape over the cut out sticker (helps to
                    line up when applying).</li>
                <li>Die Cuts are the sticker in the shape of the design with the backing paper.</li>
                <li>A Slap is a just a rectangular design usually for car bumpers.</li>
                <li>Holo Stickers are stickers that have holographic features.</li>
                <li>Large Stickers are stickers that are usually larger than 12" and are designed to be stuck on large surfaces.
                </li>
                <li>Reverse Stickers are designed to be stuck on inside surfaces so the sticky part is usually on the design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How long does it take for a preorder or backorder to ship?</strong><br><br>A preorder usually is announced 2
                weeks before our stock arrives, once it arrives it will be shipped out as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Same with a backorder. In some cases, our popular products sell out faster than we anticipate, so you may see
                backorders pop up here and there. They are usually restocked within 2 weeks and ship out as soon as we get stock in.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How long does shipping take?</strong><br><br>Shipping will take anywhere between 1-3 weeks depending on where you
                are. We ship our of the US so please keep that in mind.&nbsp;We’ve had various reports in different time frames
                to distance but we are always testing every fulfilment method possible to get your goodies to your ASAP. We have had
                some rare instances of packages arriving 6-8 weeks later, if you have not received your package after 6 weeks,
                please contact us with your order number. [Please refer to our <a

            <p><strong>When will my order get here?</strong><br><br>We aim to get your orders to you as soon as possible, sometimes when
                you make seperate orders within a close enough date we will try to merge them for you out of good-will. With
                Covid-19 crushing most fulfilment companies we are continually testing out new ways to get our products to you. To
                help you check on where your order is please submit a request on our <a

            <p><strong>Can I change my address?</strong><br><br>If your order has yet to be shipped, absolutely you can! However if your
                order has been shipped already to the wrong address you will be charged a $10 admin and new shipping fee to get your
                order reshipped to the right address. For that reason, please make sure your address is correct at the time of
                ordering.</p>

                it for you. We will do our best to remedy the issue.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Will X design be re-released?</strong><br><br>If there is enough demand there may be a restock of a particular
                design (If you want that to happen, make sure to send us a message on our socials for which ones you like)</p>
            <h2>Imperial Touge FAQ</h2>
            <p><span><strong>Do you offer print/installation services?<br><br></strong>No, we spend our time primarily 
                    designing for you to give you the highest quality art we can produce to meet your expectations. So 
                    installation will need to be done at a local shop in your area, look out for print, signage or car wrapping
                    shops.</span></p>
            <p><span><strong>What is the process for getting an custom design?<br><br></strong>It varies from project-to-project, so
                    please feel free to message us on social media (@imperialtouge) or send us an email (imperialtouge@gmail.com)! We
                    respond most quickly through Instagram. We’re always open for consultations and want to help you as best as we
                    can.</span></p>
